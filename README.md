# Botman Studio for PHP8.1+

## Recommended Libraries
- Laravel Telescope

## Preloaded Driver Configuration

For convenience we have pre-loaded some configuration for 3 drivers: Web, Facebook and Telegram.

### Driver & Botman Configuration

You can find the configuration files on the 'config/botman' directory, as well as your env variables on your env file.

#### What if i want to load another driver?

Easy, you need to extract the file (or manually do what "php artisan botman:install-driver {driver-name}") name under the 'stubs' directory on the driver root folder (found on vendor/botman/{driver}), copy the file and paste it on 'PROJECT_ROOT/config/botman'.

```

## About BotMan

While BotMan itself is framework agnostic, BotMan is also available as a bundle with the great [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP framework. This bundled version is called BotMan Studio and makes your chatbot development experience even better. By providing testing tools, an out of the box web driver implementation and additional tools like an enhanced CLI with driver installation, class generation and configuration support, it speeds up the development significantly.

## Documentation

You can find the BotMan and BotMan Studio documentation at [http://botman.io](http://botman.io).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
